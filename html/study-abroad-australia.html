                                    also known as 'post-secondary' education, in USA. Bachelor's programs are of four years duration, and are offered by different types of colleges. Liberal Arts colleges offer a general education in Arts and Sciences
                                    that develop general knowledge and reasoning ability. Most of these types of colleges are privately owned and have limited number of programs. Upper-Division colleges are those that offer the last two years of undergraduate
                                    programs, which are specialized. Community colleges are those that offer Associate Degrees of two years duration. On completion of such two-year Associate degrees, students join either upper-division colleges or universities
                                    to complete the balance two years for obtaining the Bachelors degree. Most community colleges are publicly owned ones and offer technical programs that prepare students for entry into job market, with Certificate and
                                    Diploma programs of six months to one year. Specialized programs like Engineering are also offered, that are equivalent to the first two years of a bachelor's degree. These are known as 'transfer' programs. Universities
                                    offer a broad range of both undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The size of universities varies greatly â€“ right from a two-bedroom apartment to campuses in thousands of acres! The range and diversity of programs
                                    offered are quite large. It is only possible to take up research work in universities and not in any other types of colleges</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="../images/statue-of-liberty.png" style="margin-right:15px;"><br/>Bachelor's level education in USA normally starts after the completion of 12 years of primary and secondary education. Hence, education beyond class
                                    XII is also known as 'post-secondary' education, in USA. Bachelor's programs are of four years duration, and are offered by different types of colleges. Liberal Arts colleges offer a general education in Arts and Sciences
                                    that develop general knowledge and reasoning ability. Most of these types of colleges are privately owned and have limited number of programs. Upper-Division colleges are those that offer the last two years of undergraduate
                                    programs, which are specialized. Community colleges are those that offer Associate Degrees of two years duration. On completion of such two-year Associate degrees, students join either upper-division colleges or universities
                                    to complete the balance two years for obtaining the Bachelors degree. Most community colleges are publicly owned ones and offer technical programs that prepare students for entry into job market, with Certificate and
                                    Diploma programs of six months to one year. Specialized programs like Engineering are also offered, that are equivalent to the first two years of a bachelor's degree. These are known as 'transfer' programs. Universities
                                    offer a broad range of both undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The size of universities varies greatly â€“ right from a two-bedroom apartment to campuses in thousands of acres! The range and diversity of programs
                                    offered are quite large. It is only possible to take up research work in universities and not in any other types of colleges</p>
